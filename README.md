# Deployments

Before starting the task:

*   Run the following command:
    
        $ ./deploy_deployments
    

**To check tasks and get secret phrases run:**

    $ ./checker -course 'kubernetes' -course-version 'deployments' -test-suite 'deployment'

**NOTE:** before running check after each task make sure that deployment is up and all replicas are also running.

**Task 1:**

Create a new deployment called nginx-deploy:

    Requirements:
     Name: nginx-deploy
     Image: nginx:1.19-alpine
     Namespace: default
     Replicas: 1
     Labels: app=nginx-deploy

**Do not forget to copy secret phrase, test will fail after task 3.**

**Task 2:**

Inspect the details listed above, add necessary options to `kubectl create deploy` command to produce following deployment configuration:

    Name: easy-peasy
    Image: busybox:1.34
    Replicas: 5
    Command: sleep infinity

**Task 3:**

Scale `nginx-deploy` deployment to 6 replicas.

**Task 4:**

Inspect the details listed above and create deployment:

    Deployment Name: <youname>-app
    Replicas: 1
    Deployment Labels:
      task: deploy
      app: <youname>-app
      student: <youname>
    Pod(s) Labels:
       deploy: <youname>-app
       kind: redis
       role: master
       tier: db
    Container:
       Image: redis:5-alpine
       Port: 6379
       Name: redis-master
    Init Container:
       Image: busybox:1.34
       Command: sleep 10

**Task 5:**

Current deployment `nginx-deploy` release has nginx:1.19-alpine image.New release should use nginx:1.21-alpine.Use rolling update process

**Task 6:**

A `lemon` deployment has been deployed in namespace `trouble`, but there are no pods associated with it. Figure out the root cause and fix the issue.

**Task 7:**

A `orange` deployment has been deployed in namespace `trouble`, but it doesnâ€™t work properly. Figure out the root cause and fix the issue.

  
  

This is it with deployments. To remove auomatically privisioned resources run:

    $ ./delete_deployments
